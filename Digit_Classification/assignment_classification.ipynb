Only one member per group hands in and marks the other member. **Note**: you cannot change group members after the first hand-in, so make sure you do it correct the first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The report may be brief (try to keep it under 5 pages) but it is important that you fulfill the following requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    " * The report must have a title page including names and user names (@cs) for all group members, course name, and assignment name.\n",
    " * The report should be as short as possible and as long as necessary. If your report exceeds five pages (incl. the title page), chances are that you are doing something wrong.\n",
    " * Describe how your solution works on a level that does not lose interesting details. Divide the report into two parts (one for $k$-NN, the other for the neural network), and split each part into *implementation*, *results*, and *discussion* subsections.\n",
    "   - Most important is that you describe how your solution works, and why you solved it in a particular way. Clearly state the ranges for your hyper-parameters, and explain why you chose those.\n",
    "   - Explain, and give pseudo-code for your hyper-parameter search. Explain any decisions/choices you've made.\n",
    "   - For the neural network: Plot how the loss evolve during training of your best model, and interpret the plot. The loss is available in the `MLPClassifier` after training.\n",
    "   - Describe how your work went and which problems and issues you faced when developing the program.\n",
    "   - Describe how you divided the work between you.\n",
    "   - Use clear, well written English language.\n",
    "   - You must not include your source code in the report, supply it in the Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "   - **Report your validation scores in the report.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The source code should align to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Comment the code in a reasonable way. Follow the [Docstring conventions](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/).\n",
    " * Structure your code in a suitable way, such that it is easy to follow what is going on.\n",
    " * Name classes, variables, methods, modules, *etc.*, such that the names clearly describe their function and follow the specifications given above.\n",
    " * The code you hand in should not contain sections that are not used, or unnecessary. Make sure that you understand every part of the code that you hand in.\n",
    " * **Important:** hand in a notebook that contains your execution results, i.e., execute the notebook from scratch (**Kernel** - **Re-start and run all**) and save before you hand in."

      "The MNIST database of handwritten digits with 784 features, raw data available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. It can be split in a training set of the first 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples  \n",
      "\n",
      "It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image. It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting. The original black and white (bilevel) images from NIST were size normalized to fit in a 20x20 pixel box while preserving their aspect ratio. The resulting images contain grey levels as a result of the anti-aliasing technique used by the normalization algorithm. the images were centered in a 28x28 image by computing the center of mass of the pixels, and translating the image so as to position this point at the center of the 28x28 field.  \n",
      "\n",
      "With some classification methods (particularly template-based methods, such as SVM and K-nearest neighbors), the error rate improves when the digits are centered by bounding box rather than center of mass. If you do this kind of pre-processing, you should report it in your publications. The MNIST database was constructed from NIST's NIST originally designated SD-3 as their training set and SD-1 as their test set. However, SD-3 is much cleaner and easier to recognize than SD-1. The reason for this can be found on the fact that SD-3 was collected among Census Bureau employees, while SD-1 was collected among high-school students. Drawing sensible conclusions from learning experiments requires that the result be independent of the choice of training set and test among the complete set of samples. Therefore it was necessary to build a new database by mixing NIST's datasets.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The MNIST training set is composed of 30,000 patterns from SD-3 and 30,000 patterns from SD-1. Our test set was composed of 5,000 patterns from SD-3 and 5,000 patterns from SD-1. The 60,000 pattern training set contained examples from approximately 250 writers. We made sure that the sets of writers of the training set and test set were disjoint. SD-1 contains 58,527 digit images written by 500 different writers. In contrast to SD-3, where blocks of data from each writer appeared in sequence, the data in SD-1 is scrambled. Writer identities for SD-1 is available and we used this information to unscramble the writers. We then split SD-1 in two: characters written by the first 250 writers went into our new training set. The remaining 250 writers were placed in our test set. Thus we had two sets with nearly 30,000 examples each. The new training set was completed with enough examples from SD-3, starting at pattern # 0, to make a full set of 60,000 training patterns. Similarly, the new test set was completed with SD-3 examples starting at pattern # 35,000 to make a full set with 60,000 test patterns. Only a subset of 10,000 test images (5,000 from SD-1 and 5,000 from SD-3) is available on this site. The full 60,000 sample training set is available.\n",
